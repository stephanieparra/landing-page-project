        <p>
          What can I say about conchas? They're classic. As a kid I used to take the colorful part off the top
          and leave the bread. I was really spoiled so my parents never reprimanded me lol. My fave is vanilla!<br><br>
          <strong>Pair with:</strong> Caf√© con leche y az√∫car. My dad's coffee always had sugar and milk. He'd
          always give me a bite of his concha and a sip of coffee to wash down my six-year-old gullet. Great memories.

        <p>
          So, the literal translation of this pan dulce is "enveloped child" and if you don't giggle a little
          bit when you say "I'm about to eat an enveloped child for dessert" then you're missing out on the joy
          of pan dulce dad jokes. We're just a bunch of silly geese over here. ü§ì <br><br>
          <strong>Pair with:</strong> Black coffee or espresso. These are really sweet. I mean, it's a full-on
          cake that people be eating for breakfast. Por eso estamos como estamos lol.

          alt="orejas aka palmeras de hojaldre stacked domino-style in a row on a platter" width="200" />
        <p>
          The crunch factor - that's what it's all about with these. The subtle sugaring also takes it over the edge.
          These are a texture fiend's bestie.<br><br>
          <strong>Pair with:</strong> Espresso. The contrast between a sweet, crunchy "pan" with the depth and
          bitterness of an espresso is just *chef's kiss*.

      <section aria-labelledby="polvorones">
        <h3 id="polvorones">Polvorones</h3>
        <img

          alt="polvorones tricolor, three stacked on each other like a pyramid on a plate. Some are also under the lip of the plate."
          width="200" />
        <p>
          I dunno, y'all. These literally taste like polvo and sugar to me. I love the triple color that excites
          and sucks you in, but one bite and you're like, "I knew this was gonna happen and I did it anyway."
          Are polvorones the pan dulce (or cookie) of regret? I think I'm being a hater right now. I'm sorry,
          polvorones...you <em>are</em> pretty, tho.<br><br>
          <strong>Pair with:</strong> Champurrado. Since the texture of champurrado is creamy and thick, the
          crunchy-cookie element as well as the mostly neutral taste of the polvor√≥n works well here.

      <section aria-labelledby="puerquitos">
        <h3 id="puerquitos">Puerquitos aka Marranitos aka Cochinitos</h3>

          alt="molasses-colored puerquitos, three stacked on a plate" width="200" />
        <p>
          I don't know a Mexican who doesn't like this delectable gingerbread-like delight. It has caramel-y, molasses-y
          overtones
          from the piloncillo, a slight chew, and is very cute. The best part is the satisfyingly shiny egg-wash on top!
          Se me hace agua la boca.üêñ<br><br>
          <strong>Pair with:</strong> Caf√© de Olla. As long as the caf√© de olla isn't too sweet, the puerquito goes well
          since both are made
          with piloncillo and have that complementary depth of flavor.

          alt="many empanadas stacked on top of each other in a pyramid on a platter" width="200" />
        <p>
          Empanadas de calabaza (pumpkin) are supreme. The end.<br><br>
          <strong>Pair with:</strong> Black coffee. Black coffee supremacy.
        </p>

      <section aria-labelledby="cuernitos">
        <h3 id="cuernitos">Cuernitos</h3>
        <img
          src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/shecodesio-production/uploads/files/000/018/047/original/cuernitosdepan.jpg?1633057823"
          alt="two rows of cuernitos on a black platter" width="200" />
        <p>
          Mexican-style cuernitos are interesting cuz they're not at all like French-style croissants despite looking
          like them.
          They're a lot spongier and sweeter. They're also a little more savory (not by much) than other panes. They're
          like a cake, which,
          by this point, are you surprised? I ain't mad tho.<br><br>
          <strong>Pair with:</strong> T√© de manzanilla (chamomile tea) without sugar. Or t√© de aguacate con leche
          (avocado leaf tea with whole
          milk). I remember having sweets, including the most delicious bread I've ever had in my LIFE, in my
          grandparents' hometown of Dolores,
          Chihuahua, with avocado leaf tea and milk. It was so comforting. I also didn't have stomach issues drinking
          the milk out there. But I'm
          33 now and who knows what nature has done with my body. üôÉ

        <h3 id="gorditas">Gorditas de Nata</h3>

          alt="gorditas de nata placed domino-style on a blue platter" width="200" />
        <p>
          Oh god these are so good that I'm designating them honorary pan dulce since they don't technically belong to
          the pantheon of pan dulce that you see splayed out at those church meetings our parents went to while all the
          kids were stuffed in a room watching a scary movie that one of the older kids put on (lol that was a wildly
          specific run-on sentence). Street vendors griddle these nata-filled (clotted cream), fluffy, fatty disks of
          extreme joy.<br><br>
          <strong>Pair with:</strong> Whatever you find being sold next to them, usually agua fresca. Agua de mel√≥n
          would prob go pretty good.
          Both have a sweet, neutral-ish flavor that won't overpower the other.
