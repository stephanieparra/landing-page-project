            <p>
              <strong>Conchas</strong><br />
              What can I say about conchas? They're classic. As a kid I used to
              take the colorful part off the top and leave the bread. I was really
              spoiled so my parents never reprimanded me lol. My fave is
              vanilla!<br />
              <br />
              <strong>Pair with:</strong> Caf√© con leche y az√∫car. My dad's coffee
              always had sugar and milk. He'd always give me a bite of his concha
              and a sip of coffee to wash down my six-year-old gullet. Great
              memories. üíï

            <p>
              <strong>Ni√±o Envuelto aka Mexican Jelly Roll</strong>
              <br />
              So, the literal translation of this pan dulce is "enveloped child"
              and if you don't giggle a little bit when you say "I'm about to eat
              an enveloped child for dessert" then you're missing out on the joy
              of pan dulce dad jokes. We're just a bunch of silly geese over here.
              ü§ì <br /><br />
            <strong>Pair with:</strong> Black coffee or espresso. These are
            really sweet. I mean, it's a full-on cake that people be eating for
            breakfast. Por eso estamos como estamos lol.
          </p>

            alt="orejas aka palmeras de hojaldre stacked in a row on a platter"

          />
          <p>
            <strong>Orejas aka Palmeras de Hojaldre</strong><br />
            The crunch factor - that's what it's all about with these. The
            subtle sugaring also takes it over the edge. These are a texture
            fiend's bestie.<br /><br />
            <strong>Pair with:</strong> Espresso. The contrast between a sweet,
            crunchy "pan" (I guess it's more of a pastry?) with the depth and
            bitterness of an espresso is just *chef's kiss*.

            alt="polvorones tricolor strewn on a plate"
            width="200"
          />
          <p>
            <strong>Polvorones</strong><br />
            I dunno, y'all. These literally taste like polvo and sugar to me. I
            love the triple color that excites and sucks you in, but one bite
            and you're like, "I knew this was gonna happen and I did it anyway."
            Are polvorones the pan dulce (or cookie) of regret? I think I'm
            being a hater right now. I'm sorry, polvorones...you
            <em>are</em> pretty, tho.<br /><br />
            <strong>Pair with:</strong> Champurrado. Since the texture of
            champurrado is creamy and thick, the crunchy-cookie element as well
            as the mostly neutral taste of the polvor√≥n works well here.

          <p>
            <strong>Puerquitos aka Marranitos aka Cochinitos</strong><br />
            I don't know a Mexican who doesn't like this delectable
            gingerbread-like delight. It has caramel-y, molasses-y overtones
            from the piloncillo, a slight chew, and is very cute. The best part
            is the satisfyingly shiny egg-wash on top! Se me hace agua la
            boca.üêñ<br /><br />
            <strong>Pair with:</strong> Caf√© de Olla. As long as the caf√© de
            olla isn't too sweet, the puerquito goes well since both are made
            with piloncillo and have that complementary depth of flavor.

            <strong>Empanadas</strong><br />
            Empanadas de calabaza (pumpkin) are supreme. The end.<br /><br />
            <strong>Pair with:</strong> Black coffee. Black coffee supremacy.

            alt="cuernitos on a black platter"
            width="200"
          />
          <p>
            <strong>Cuernitos</strong><br />
            Mexican-style cuernitos are interesting cuz they're not at all like
            French-style croissants despite looking like them. They're a lot
            spongier and sweeter. They're also a little more savory (not by
            much) than other panes. They're like a cake, which, by this point,
            are you surprised? I ain't mad tho.<br /><br />
            <strong>Pair with:</strong> T√© de manzanilla (chamomile tea) without
            sugar. Or t√© de aguacate con leche (avocado leaf tea with whole
            milk). I remember having sweets, including the most delicious bread
            I've ever had in my LIFE, in my grandparents' hometown of Dolores,
            Chihuahua, with avocado leaf tea and milk. It was so comforting. I
            also didn't have stomach issues drinking the milk out there. But I'm
            33 now and who knows what nature has done with my body. üôÉ

          <p>
            <strong>Gorditas de Nata</strong><br />
            Oh god these are so good that I'm designating them honorary pan
            dulce since they don't technically belong to the pantheon of pan
            dulce that you see splayed out at those church meetings our parents
            went to while all the kids were stuffed in a room watching a scary
            movie that one of the older kids put on (lol that was a wildly
            specific run-on sentence). Street vendors griddle these nata-filled
            (clotted cream), fluffy, fatty disks of extreme joy.<br /><br />
            <strong>Pair with:</strong> Whatever you find being sold next to
            them, usually agua fresca. Agua de mel√≥n would prob go pretty good.
            Both have a sweet, neutral-ish flavor that won't overpower the
            other.
